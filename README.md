#Simple Church

## What
"Simple Church" is an app that 1) provides out-of-the-box functionality for churches to run their logistics through and 2) to connect those hosting Christian gatherings with those searching for fellowship and corporeal worship.

## Who
[Phillip Chan](https://twitter.com/phillipchan2) and [Gregory
Oladipo](https://twitter.com/gregoryoladipo) are both Christians; and both of them
are software engineers. 

"And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one
another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near." Hebrews 10:25
